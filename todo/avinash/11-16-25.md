backend tasks:

1. generate previews of different files ands save it to storage and db
  - previes are getting saved to the same storage as files
  - a new folder '.imaginary' is created in root path to save all previews
  - after saving preview file its object is also created in db which is used to fetch preview under proxy server
  - we show preview conditionally:
    - if preview is generated for the file then we show that preview
    - if preview is not generated but its a image file then we show image itself as preview
    - for other files we show default file preview icon
    - currently supported preview file types are: images, videos, pdfs, audio
    - for some of the files we need system level dependencies like ffmpeg for video and audio preview generation
    - for this we need to install those dependencies first
    - also updated the docker file to include those dependencies in docker image

3. implement delete logic for files and folders
4. implement sharing logic for files
